# System's Security Strengthening with Linux

System strengthening with Linux means making sure your Linux computer or server is secure and running smoothly by protecting it from threats and improving its performance.

## Here’s why it’s important:

- [Security](#Hackers can try to break into your system, steal data, or cause harm. Strengthening your system means setting up protections like firewalls, updates, and monitoring, so your system is less likely to be compromised.)
- [Performance](#Over time, your system can slow down or become cluttered. Strengthening it involves optimizing resources (like memory and disk space), so your system runs faster and more efficiently.)
